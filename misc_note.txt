jam dissolution: "slower is faster". jam can be reduced if entering traffic is more uniform in speed, without sudden brakes
jam dissolution: on-ramp meters control to reduce main road traffic jam
LoRA is very widely used in LLM fine-tuning
most work focus on embedding external factors explicitly into prompt. one of S-lab plays with embedding layer; point is translating domain knowledge into natural language for LLM understanding
traffic flow analysis can be not data-driven; analytic approach vs. data driven approach, this point should be important for LLM design
