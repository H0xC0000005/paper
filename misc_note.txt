jam dissolution: "slower is faster". jam can be reduced if entering traffic is more uniform in speed, without sudden brakes
jam dissolution: on-ramp meters control to reduce main road traffic jam
LoRA is very widely used in LLM fine-tuning
most work focus on embedding external factors explicitly into prompt. one of S-lab plays with embedding layer; point is translating domain knowledge into natural language for LLM understanding
traffic flow analysis can be not data-driven; analytic approach vs. data driven approach, this point should be important for LLM design

use VLM to predict event size and its impact on traffic 

TSC can also work on single intersection while be aware of queue impact. long queues can cause subsequent traffic jams in corresponding segments, evolving into "jam clusters";
if some directions in a single intersection may be overloaded or jammed upstream, signal control scheme may differ and can better resolve such situations

effect of yellow light in TSC? how we model it? I haven't seen much about explicit modeling; phases usually don't consider yellow lights

by controling traffic light intentionally, traffic distribution may change to a new one where the total delay time is benefited! this technique may be useful in overloaded intersections.

what if same agents in TSC coordinate in connected intersections? what if they cannot communicate but can see surrounding data? 
pressure are good ways in traditional RL TSC literature, what if we apply it to multiple intersections, or even integrate OD graph to define pressure and coordinate multiple intersections?

irregular TSC phases in heavy traffic would help? e.g. 1-2 straight+turn > 1-2 straight + 2-1 straight ...

what if we integrate OD graph analysis with microscopic traffic phase analysis with LLM? LLM may be aware of external factors encoded by OD and sudden events in explainable manners
this may be useful in generating jam warnings and predict travel time in advance

LLMs are used to improve traffic model quality. some works construct automatic pipelines to evolve and evaluate traffic model, adding aux terms. what if we apply this in TSC criteria, e.g. utilize beyond traditional criteria such as queue length and pressure?

how can LLM help to develop schemes in irregular intersections? or irregular combination of regular intersections?

mutli-agent LLM on intersection network, or LLM aware of multi-agent control of an intersection network?

RL + LLM in TSC; RL in charge of expert advice, LLM in charge of coordination & semantic comparison; this can be applied to multi-intersection setting. 
in other words, LLM is a "fixing cap"

rat running modeling?
