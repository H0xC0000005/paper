Papers similar to my proposal:
- notes:
  - some similar work on "feature mining" (one-time or iterative discovery), my idea can be based on feature improvements/universal features/compact representation
  - maybe I can show that single agents can work as well as mult-agent architectures? (evaluation module as fixed coded module without LLM). or maybe a fine-tuned LLM evaluator?
  - peer works focus on "data centric tasks" while my idea can work on simulation or analycic tasks
  - existing works do not provide causes of model performance! at least not explainable; this should be novelty in simulation/analycic tasks
  - introducing non-linearity by LLM (maybe can be viewed as distillation of pre-trained knowledge in LLM)
  - there are works using LLM-ML teaming. maybe training data of RL (e.g. gradients) can be utilized?
  - works on classic models (e.g. rand forest) rely on prior of model structure... maybe RL application (reward signal learning) can have novelty?
  - maybe... we can let LLM watching the simulation (while let LLM specify what to observe) and do self-critique? (basic statistics can be provided)
  - island memory is a genetic programming approach, good for encouraging exploration
  - would MoE be applied in such cases, hoping to discover more fine-grained features/knowledges in different subdomains?
  - dispatcher-free MoE-LLM (let each LLM analyze what is its advantage, propose what to do and only focus on the proposal)?
